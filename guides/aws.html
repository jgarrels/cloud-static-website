                This tutorial will focus on deploying a static website
                with AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), using the AWS
                CLI. The same result can also be achieved with the
                AWS Console.

                <li>An AWS account.</li>
                <li>The AWS CLI installed on your local machine.</li>

            <h2>Getting started with an S3 bucket</h2>
            <p>
                Before creating the S3 bucket, please make sure your region is set
                in <code>~/.aws/credentials</code>: In our example, this is
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>region=us-east-1</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can test if everything is working fine with the command
                <code>aws s3 ls</code> - if everything is configured correctly,
                this should display your existing buckets in that region or
                nothing if you have no buckets there. Otherwise there will be
                an error.
            </p>
            <p>Now let's get going and create the S3 bucket for our website.
                We'll be using the command <code>aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, <code>mb</code> is short for "make bucket" and the bucket
                name "my-bucket" is the name of the bucket that will be created.
                Two caveats here:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bucket names need to be unique across all of AWS -
                        you might run into an error if you try to create a bucket
                        whose name is already being used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bucket name will be included in the default web
                        address AWS provides for your bucket. This will later
                        be the default address for our website. Make sure to
                        choose something that matches the content of your website.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You can find more information about S3 bucket names
                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To verify that your bucket was created successfully, you can use
                <code>aws s3 ls</code> again - the bucket should now appear in the list.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Syncing your website files to your S3 bucket</h2>
            <p>
                Now we'd like to upload our website files to the S3 bucket, and we'd
                like them to stay in sync when we change something in the files.
                In order to achieve this, we will use the <code>sync</code> command.
            </p>
            <code>aws s3 sync local-path s3-uri --acl "public-read"</code>
            <p>
                Let's break this command down:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <code>sync</code> command will sync our local files with
                        the S3 bucket (creating new files, updating existing files).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>local-path</code> needs to be replaced with the path to your
                        website files on your machine or on a GitHub repository.
                        If you are in the working directory containing your website
                        files, this will just be <code>.</code> (a single dot
                        - represents the current directory). You can see your current
                        working directory in your terminal by running the command
                        <code>pwd</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bucket URI <code>s3-uri</code> is just what you typed in
                        when creating the bucket: <code>s3://my-bucket</code> (again:
                        replace <code>my-bucket</code> with your actual bucket name).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            --acl "public-read"
                        </code>
                        configures the access policy to our bucket files - in this case, 
                        <code>public-read</code> which means everybody will be able to 
                        see our website, but only we can change it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to exclude some files, you can use the
                <code>--exclude string</code> flag
                at the end of your command. An example: I did not want to upload my git
                repository files to the S3 bucket, so my command looked like this:
            </p>
            <code>
                s3 sync . s3://my-bucket --exclude ".git/*"
            </code>
            <p>
                Here I used the usual shell conventions for the wildcard <code>*</code>.
                This command then syncs my local files to the S3 bucket, with the exception
                of the .git folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have deleted some files locally and want to reflect that on your
                website/S3 bucket, include <code>--delete</code> to allow S3 to delete
                files that do not exist on your local repository anymore.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Congratulations!
            </h3>
            <p>
                You have now uploaded your files to your S3 bucket. In the next step,
                we will enable static website hosting for the bucket so our website
                will finally be accessible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Enabling static website hosting</h2>
            <p>
                This is the last step to get our website running. We will
                use the <code>website</code> command to enable static website
                hosting for the S3 bucket with our website files. The code for it
                looks like this:
            </p>
            <code>aws s3 website s3://my-bucket/ 
                --index-document index.html --error-document error.html</code>
            <p>
                Let's break this down step by step.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>s3://my-bucket</code> is the S3 URI as explained in
                        the last step. You will need to replace <code>my-bucket</code>
                        with the name of the bucket you created.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The index document is the document that contains your landing 
                        page (home page, start page - whatever it is in your case). 
                        If yours has a different name, just replace 
                        <code>index.html</code> in the command with the correct name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The error document is optional, but can be helpful. Whenever 
                        someone calls your website with a link that does not exist,
                        S3 will redirect them to this page. A suitable choice would 
                        be something with a 404 not found message.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
