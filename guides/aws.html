                This tutorial will focus on deploying a static website
                with AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), using the AWS 
                CLI. The same result can also be achieved with the 
                AWS Console.

            <h2>Getting started with an S3 bucket</h2>
            <p>
                Before creating the S3 bucket, please make sure your region is set
                in <code>~/.aws/credentials</code>: In our example, this is
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>region=us-east-1</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can test if everything is working fine with the command 
                <code>aws s3 ls</code> - if everything is configured correctly,
                this should display your existing buckets in that region or 
                nothing if you have no buckets there. Otherwise there will be 
                an error.
